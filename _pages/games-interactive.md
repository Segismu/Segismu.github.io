<h1>Games & Interactive</h1>

<p>I explore narrative design and game development as extensions of my cinematic and literary work. Through personal projects and game jam experiments, I aim to build immersive, emotionally charged experiences grounded in story and atmosphere.</p>

<p><em>Fantasya</em> is a first-person dungeon crawler inspired by 90s RPGs and psychological narratives. Developed in Unreal Engine 5, it connects directly to the world of my film <em>Intense Creatures</em>, offering a complementary experience through interactive storytelling, obscure mechanics, and a cryptic world driven by memory and obsession.</p>

<!-- GLOBAL GAME JAM -->
<h2>Global Game Jams</h2>
<p><strong>Game Designer & Narrative Lead</strong> · Collaborative Projects</p>
<p>Across several editions of the Global Game Jam, I've created short experimental games with small teams. Each project served as a playground to explore interactive storytelling, emergent mechanics, and low-fi aesthetics.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Echoes from Below</strong> (2024) – Puzzle horror built around cassette manipulation.</li>
  <li><strong>Lost Signal</strong> (2023) – Exploration narrative about grief and cosmic messages.</li>
  <li><strong>Resonancia</strong> (2022) – Top-down puzzle about memory loops.</li>
</ul>

<!-- CONCEPTUAL / EXPERIMENTS -->
<h2>Interactive Experiments</h2>
<p>I'm also developing prototypes and tools that blend code, poetry, and interactive fiction. These include Twine-based microgames, glitch art pieces, and experimental engines for custom narrative mechanics.</p>
