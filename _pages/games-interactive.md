<h1>Games & Interactive</h1>

<p>I explore narrative design and game development as extensions of my cinematic and literary work. This is the area Im most passionated with. Through personal projects and game jams, I strive to learn and dip deeper into this media.</p>

<p><em>Fantasya</em> Is a short, simple first-person dungeon crawler inspired by 90s RPGs and psychological narratives. Developed in Unreal Engine 5, it connects directly to the world of our film <em>Deep Creatures</em>, offering a complementary experience through interactive storytelling, obscure mechanics, and a cryptic world driven by memory and obsession.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Bubble Bee</strong> (2025) – Puzzle about a bee and honey bubbles.</li>
  <li><strong>Let'em Eat Cake</strong> (2024) – Just do it.</li>

<!-- CONCEPTUAL / EXPERIMENTS -->
<h2>Interactive Experiments</h2>
<p>I'm also developing prototypes and tools that blend code, poetry, and interactive fiction. These include Twine-based microgames, glitch art pieces, and experimental engines for custom narrative mechanics. Our current project is a short film-game called The Interview.</p>
